# Midterm Review - 4/29/15


## Tips
- Questions will be more general (i.e. when he says highlands, he means highlands in general, not on the Moon or Mercury specifically)
- Lots of free whitespace on test, you don't have to fill everything up - its not what is expected
- 8 points questions generally mean two answers (coagulate information), compare things etc.
- No multiple choice
- The final is not cumulative
- There are no crater density questions
- If he asks for an age, put an age as exact as possible
- Remember units
- No blob tectonics
- Rarely asks greenhouse questions


## Miscellaneous Facts
- Primary atmosphere is the inital atmosphere that existed during the early days of the solar system that was composed of H_2 and He, but due to them being very light they were lost quickly
- Secondary atmospheres are atmospheres created by evaporated gasses from materials on the surfaces on planets (eg O_2 and CO_2 on Earth)
- When he asks a question regarding dinosaurs, talk about the impact stuff, not what actually killed them
- Geologically simple worlds are worlds with surface features caused by impacts, such as craters and the presence of impact breccia, but when he talks about geologically complex worlds, talk about features caued by volcanic activity, such as basalt etc.
- For the Apollo missions, talk about how they retrieved samples - he doesn't ask us about anything else
- CO_2 is removed from the surface of Earth due to weathering of rocks, but this does not happen on Venus due to the lack of weathering as the atmosphere does not interact with the surface (also there is no life on Venus)
    + ef question: He makes up a world and tells us that the atmosphere does not interact with the surface, he would ask us why there is no CO_2 in the atmoshpere
- Late heavy bombardment was 3.8 Byrs ago


## Common Mistakes
- People ususally lose points not because they don't know the facts, but rather because they fuck up explaining things
- A lot of people lose points for not reading the question fully
