# Outer Worlds - 5/12/15


## Question of the Day
- What are the types/characteristics of giant planet sattelites?
- What is the Roche limit of a planet?
- How are the surfaces of Dead worlds (Callisto & co.) similar/different from the Earth's Moon?


## Giant Planet Sattelites
- Sattelites of Giant planets are generally categorized into the following areas:
    + Rings
    + Regular Sattelites
    + Irregular Sattelites

### Irregular Sattelites
- Generally very small (i.e. asteroid sized, about 500km on average)
- Formed by caputre
- Their orbits usually have the following characteristics
    + Prograde and retrograde (i.e. orbits in same direction as orbit and vice versa respectively)
    + High eccentricity
    + High inclination
    + Far from planet

### Regular Sattelites
- Generally large (about the size of the moon)
- Formed by co-accrection
- Orbits generally have the following characteristics
    + Prograde orbits
    + Low eccentricity (nearly spherical)
    + Low inclination (orbits above the equator)
    + Close to the planet
- Synchronous rotation (i.e. the same side always faces the planet)
- Composed of Ice and Rock

### Rings
- Very small (i.e. cm to m)
- Formed by ?
- Orbits generally have the following characteristics
    + Prograde
    + Very low eccentricity (i.e. circular)
    + Very low inclination (i.e. orbits above the equator)
    + Very close to the planet
- Gravitational force is proportional to Mm/d^2 (i.e. Newton's third law)


## Roche Limit
- The tidal force is the outward force exerted by a mass, when attracted towards another point mass in orbit around a planet
- The graviational force is the mutual attraction of a mass to its host planet
- At distances below the Roche limit, F_grav < F_tidal
- On the flip side, beyond the Roche limit F_grav > F_Tidal, so objects can move away from its host planet
- Accretion is the collisional growth of objects (i.e. small objects come toether to form larger objects)
    + Thus, beyond the Roche limit Accretion is possible
- The Roche limit for a planet is about 2.5*Radius
- Thus, as if it closer than the Roche limit, it would crash into the planet and if it were beyond the limit it would float away, planetary rings generally form at or very near the Roche limit


## Planet Ring Analysis
- Physics shows that they are not complete solid objects, as they would be too unstable to small pertivations (i.e. the effect of small fluctuations on the large scale)
- Reflectance spectra (Electron excitations, photon absorption and emissions etc.) are used to determine the compositions and relative thicknesses of these rings
    + Analysis shows that Saturn's rings are mostly frost, and are about 10m-100m thick in general
    + The total ring mass of Saturn is estimated to be about that of a 200km diameter asteroid
