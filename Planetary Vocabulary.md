# Planetary Vocabulary - 4/2/15


## Question of the Day
- How were they formed?
- What is the source of their energy?
- How can you determine the *relative age* of a planetary surface?


## Facts about the Moon
- Density 3.34 g/cm^3 Mostly rock
- Albedo: 0.11 Dark rock
- Moment of inertia: 0.393 Almost homogenous
- Size: 27% Earth
- Mass: 1.2% Earth
- Gravity: 1/6th Earth


## Geographic Features

### Mare
- Caused by volcanic eruptions on the moon (i.e. Lava flow)
- It is the youngest part of the surface of the moon
- Low albedo
- Few craters

### Highlands
- High albedo
- Many craters
- Many impacts
- Much older than the Mare


## Craters
- Characterized by Galileo in 1610
- Formed by both internal processes and impact
- "Face of the Moon" by Ralph Baldwin correcetly characterized craters on the moon
    + Proved that craters were formed by explosion impacts

### Impact Processes
- Energy to create crater is from the Kinetic energy of the meteor on impact (i.e. Exogenetic Source of energy)
    + A baseball hitting the surface at typical impact velocity of a meteor would create a crater with a diameter of 10m

### Impact Breccia
- Rock composed of broken fragments of minerals, rocks or even other pieces of breccia

### Types of Craters
#### Simple Impact Craters (<10km diameter)
- Bowl shaped
- Slow-sloping
- Depth of the deepest rocks ~1/10th crater diameter
        * Deepest rocks are closer to the rim

#### Complex impact crater (10km - 100km diameter)
- Terraced rim
- Central peaks

#### Impact Basins (>100km diameter)
- HUGE craters
- Impact basins on the moon are visible by naked eye from Earth

#### Secondary craters
- Impacts caused by the impacts of ejected material (meta af)
- No explosion, material simply plows into the rock
- Small, not circular

#### Rays
- Material blown out by the explosions from impacts
- Looks like the spokes of a bicycle wheel

#### Ghost Craters
- Crater changed by other processes


## Volcanic and Tectonic Processes
- Originate internally, with energy from the radioactive decay of elements
    + Potassium (K), Thorium (Th) and Uranium (U)
    + Amount of head is always decreasing

### Planetary differentiation
- The process of seperating out different constituents of a planetary body as a consequence of their physical and chemical behavior
- Basically, this is where during the molten state lighter materials drift to the top and cool first, creating an inwardly-heavy core

### Volcanic Processes
- Sinuous Rilles (Lava channels), is a word used to describe a 'groove' caused by the flow of lava on the lunar surface
- When underground *lava tubes* collapse, the roof of the tubes collapse and form change of crators
- The viscosity of lunar magma is similar to that of maple syrup

#### Lava Flows (Mare, Pl: Maria)
- Basalt - rocks formed from the cooling of lava at or near the surface

### Tectonic Processes
- Extension and compression
- Straight Rilles lead are faults caused by extension processes (controversial)
- Wrinkle ridges are caused by compression


## Ages
- Global vs Local
    + Global ages are on the scale of planets, whereas local ages are on for individual items on the surface of the planets in question
- Ages can be relative (i.e. old or young) or absolute (i.e. 4.0 Byrs 3.6 Byrs)
- Relative ages can be based on **Stratiagraphy**
    + This is the concept that younger material is on top (i.e. near the surface) and older materials are down below
- Relative ages can be based on crater counting
    + If there is a Mare with few craters, it is young
    + If there are highlands with many craters, it is old
- Crater density
    + The number of craters within a certain area
    + Cumulative crater denisty
        * Only count craters larger than some size, D
        * Notation N(D) = Number of craters with diameter greater than or equal to D per million square km
        * For Mare, N(10) = ~10
        * For Highlands, N(10) >= 300
- Crater population
    + Relative number of differently sized craters
    + Surfaces have the same density, but different makeups
    + The crater popualtion changes over time (larger craters give way to more smaller craters)
- Absolute ages
    + Determined using radiation dating from returned samples (for now)
