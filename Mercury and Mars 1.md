# Mercury and Mars 1 - Geological History - 4/14/15


## Questions of the Day
- How do we determine when the geological events on Mercury and Mars happened?
- Why might our timing of these events be wrong?
- Geological activity scales with size
    + What does this mean?
    + Why does this happen?
- How does the geological history of Mercury and Mars differ from that of the Moon?


## Crater Population (R-Plot)
- Relative number of different sized v % of surface covered
- This plot implies that Mercury and Mars experienced impacts from the same object, at the same rate in the same proportion
- We can count craters on a surface (in our solar system), and compare it to a known lunar surface to determine the absolute age of the surfaces on Mercury and Mars


## Mercury

### Geological Facts
- Density 5.2g/cm^3 (most dense planet in Solar System) Iron and Rock
- Moment of Inertia 0.34 Massive Iron Core
- Albedo 0.12 Dark Rock
- Size 38%
- Mass 6%
- Gravity 41%
- Surface Temperature 700F (Day), -300F (Night) [No atmosphere]


### Mercury Exploration
- First Mercury Flyby was by the spacecraft Mariner
- Showed us about 40% of Mercury's surface
- LEAST explored planet in our solar system
- Only 3 flybys
- 'Messenger' was the first sattelite to be put in orbit of Mercury. It will impact the surface on April 30th, as it is out of all of its maneuvering fuel
- This showed that there were no Mare surfaces on Mars visually, but crater impact maps show that there is in fact Mare on Mercury
- Highlands on Mercury and highland surfaces on the Moon formed at about the same time (4 Byrs ago), as evidenced by similar crater densities on Mercury and Lunar Mare and Highlands
- Mercury mare surfaces has the same geological features as that of the moon (lava tubes etc)
- Large impact basins on the Moon and Mercury are about the same age (these were caused by late-heavy bombardment)

#### Unique Geological Features of Mercury
- There are a lot of small bumps, that make the surface appear similar to sandpaper, exacrly opposite the large impact basin on Mercury
    + It is hypothesized that the large impact caused large showckwaves to propogate through Mercury's large iron core, which caused the surface to be permutated
    + The reason this is not prevelant on the moon is because of the Rock core of the moon, which is not as conductive to translating shock waves through its planetary core
- As the core of mercury cools, it will contract [iron contracts when it cools], it will cause the surface of Mercury to become chaotic, as it will reduce the size of the core, which will create a 'wrinkling' on the surface


## Mars

### Historic Exploration Facts
- We sent the first space craft to Mars in 1960 [from the Soviet Union]
    + Almost all of the Soviet Union crafts were destroyed before landing on the surface, either on impact or on launch
    + They "crapped out" - Toby Smith

### Geological Facts
- Density 3.8g/cm^3 Rock and (a little) Iron
- Moment of Inertia 0.335 Core
- Albedo 0.15 (average) 0.11-0.50 Varied Terrain
- Size 53% Earth
- Mass 11% Earth
- Gravity 40% Earth
- Surface Temperature -10C (Day) -50C (Night)
- Atmosphere 0.006 ATM (VERY) thin

### Facts
- A world that is 'halfway' between the Earth and the Moon in terms of activity
- Radioactive decay is a one-way process
    + i.e. the amount of heat is always decreasing
    + How long this lasts is COMPLETELY dependent on how big worlds are (the Earth is relatively large, so it has [and will] last for a long time)
- When heat from Radioactive decay is burned, it is dissipated from the surface
    + The larger the surface area/volume ratio, the faster it cools
    + With a SA/V ratio of 1.9*Earth (ref. of 1), it would have taken longer for it to cool than compared to the Moon for example, which has a SA/V ratio of 3.7*Earth
- This leads us to the hypothesis that geological activity is directly proportional to size
    + So, Mars is basically in between the Earth and Moon in terms of Geological Activity

### Observations
- All of the imact craters on the surface of Mars have a  'weird' shape compared to those of Mercury and the Moon, as if though there is a 'pedestal' around the impact craters
    + Visually, it looks like mud gushed out of the crater and then proceeded to dry afterwards, forming a 'pedestal'
- Some other craters have 'teardrop' patterns around them
    + This led scientists to believe that catastrophic floods flowed around the craters, flowing around the impact sites of the craters
- The channels cutting through the highlands on Mars indicates that water channels cut through this area of the planet
- The 'bulge' on the equator of Mars is the direct result of volcanic eruptions on the surface of Mars. In fact, it is home to the largest Volcano in the solar system (Mount Olympus)
    + The ages of the surface near the bulge is as young as 100M years, which is basically yesterday in the context of the ages of objects in the Solar System
    + The size of Mount Olympus is about the size of Washington State
- Due to the higher force of Earth's gravitational force, it is impossible for Mountains as large as Mount Olympus to exist, as the strength of the rock is not enough to sustain the pressure of a mountin that high
- Mars DOES NOT have plate tectonics
- Mariner Valley (the large 'crack' near the equator of Mars) would span the entire width of continental North America, and is 7km deep
- As Mars is larger than the Moon, its geological activity lasted MUCH longer than that of the Moon, but it is now in the 'Big Chill' phase (it JUST entered the Big Chill phase)
    + Now, like the moon the only thing affecting the surface of Mars is impacts
- However, Mars has an atmosphere. Granted, it is very small, but it is enough for wind, and enough to transport material that can change the surface of the planet
