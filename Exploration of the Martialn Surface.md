# Exploration of the Surface of Mars - 4/16/15

## Questions of the Day
- How has our perception of Mars changed over the last 100 years?
- Where do you look for water/life?
- What is the evidence that Mars once had liquid water on its surface?

## History of Exploration
- The first map was made about 200 years ago, when humans first started making relatively large telescopes
- Percival Lowell, a man from Masachusetts invested his inheritance in an observatory in Arizona. Its still being used today
    + A lot of people considered hi to be a scientist, even though he wasn't. "He just built a really big ass telescope"
    + He incorrectly perceived craters on the surface of Mars to be patches of vegetation and/or water bodies
- The first spacecraft to orbit Mars was the spacecraft MAriner 4, which sent back the first images of the surface of MArs from orbit on July 15, 1965
- What was previously thought to be vegetation and/or canals from early observations from Earth were found to be just craters, and Mars turned out to be a barren desert land


## Martian Landers

### Viking Missions (Viking 1 and Viking 2)
- There were two identical spacecraft, Viking 1 and 2 sent to two different parts of Mars
- Viking 1 and 2 were stationary landers, that sent us back the first view of the surface of Mars
- The first image returned from the surface of Mars was one with the leg of the lander. This was done incase only one image could be sent back, scientists wanted an image with context
- The first images from Viking showed a light sky, with minimal cloud cover as opposed to the inky black that was found on the moon
- The pricipal reason for sending the Viking landers to Mars was to search for signs of life
- The issue with the Viking landers is that they were only sampling soil up to two inches deep
    + One of the experiments however turned up something interesting
    + One of the soil samples picked up and dropped into one of the experiment basins caused changes in the atmosphere above the sample. Debate ensued as to whether or not this was caused by a Biological or Chemical process
    + This controversy sparked articles with titles like "Viking accused of killing martian life"
- The total cost of the Viking missions was ~$1 Billion dollars (about the cost of ONE shuttle mission)

### Mars Pathfinder
- There was a spacecraft called the Pathfinder, which was launched in 1996
- It was basically a 'flower' that unfolded to expand surface area for solar panels
- This 'flower' served as a base/charging station for the first rover sent to mars
- It was sent to a landing site not too far from Viking 1
- The mission as only designed to run for a couple of weeks, despite the fact that the batteries were rechargable using the solar panels
- It had an extensible 'nose' that could analyze the composition of soil samples
- It ended up lasting about 90 days
- This composition detection system showed that the composition of all of the soil across a relatively large area had about the same compostion

### Spirit Rover
- The scientific purpose of this rover was tagged as not looking for life on the surface of Mars, but rather that it would look for conditions that would/could have sustained life
- Due to the large temperature variation on the surface of Mars, water undergoes sublimation (i.e. it changes state from Solid to Gas and vice versa, bypassing the liquid state)
- This rover pioneered a new way of landing larger payloads on the surface with a semi-controlled descent using a combination of a thruster and an impact cusioning system (space airbags)
- Landed in the middlen of a Lacustrine environment
- As with the Apollo missions, the Spirit rover began travelling to the edges of impact craters to determine the compostion of the soil underground (thrown up by the impact of the asteroid)
- This showed that most/all of the soil on Mars was Olivine-rich
    + This was discouraging for scientists, as Oliving is the first material to dissolve on contact with water. This implied that the supposed Lacustrine surface the rover landed on never came into contact with water, but was rather a plane caused by anceint lava flow
- Spirit got stuck in 2009, and became a stationary sattelite for a year before it was shut down in 2010. It was designed to last 90 days, but it lasted 2269, and it was deisgned to travel 1km, but it actually travelled 8

### Opportunity Rover
- It landed on a plane full of craters, which was believed to have once been covered by water, by observational sattelites in orbit around Mars
    + The surface appeared to be relatively rich in Hematite, the mineral form of Iron Oxide
- All of the rocks near the landing site of Opportunity were small rocks the size of blueberry, which turned out to be pure Hematite
- The large slabs of rocks were layered rocks, which appeared to have been dissolved and piled together in sedimentary layers
- As analysis of the rocks started from the rim of the basin working down, the salt concentration increased as the rover moved down the basin. This was a good sign, as it indicated that it could have once been filled with water, as it implied that a salt water body evaporated (as it evaporates, the concentration of salt tends to infinity as the volume of water reduces and the amount of salt stays constant)
- As the rover moved away from the basin towards the 'Columbia' Hills, Spirit became the first Earth-originated mountaneer on mars. Soil became very salty, and the Hematite blueberry rocks gave way to salty soil
- Opportunity kept going on the surface of mars, traversing the entire plane it landed on, and it visited multiple other craters
- As of 4/16/15, it is still going on the surface of Mars. It too was designed to last for 90 days, but has lasted over 10 years now and just passed the 26 mile marathon mark of land traversal on the surface of Mars!

### Phoenix Lander
- Lander, not a rover which was different from Spirit and Opportunity
- It landed near the North pole of Mars, with the goal of locating Ice
- Phoenix had a sample arm to dig into the surface on the surface or Mars. After diging a few inches into the surface, it hit a white layer, which was obviously ice. Another picture taken about 4 days later showed the white layer shriking nominally, which was indicative of the ice evaporating
- A picture of the arm on Phoenix showed two 'drops' moving together. This was unique, as both the pressure and temperature are too low to sustain liquid water. Scientists determind that it was extremely highly concentrated with Magnesium Chloride (MgCl_2), which acted as a coolant for the liquid

### Curiosity Rover
- About the size of a Mini Cooper (fucking huge)
    + Larges unmanned man-made object landed on a different planet by humans
- It landed in the Summer of 2012
- Due to the large volume, it could not be powered with solar panels, so it has a nuclear reactor mounted on the back
- It had a new innovative landing system, as the airbag system could not handle such a large payload. It used the 'sky crane' model (look on YouTube for simulation video)
- It landed in the 'Gale Crater', and its goal was to land on the base and travel to the center, up the peak
    + Thei mages of the Gale Crater show that the sides of the mountain in the center is very similar visually to the sides of the grand canyon, which is indivative of sediment layers accumulating over time
- The rover had to drive away from the landing site, as the rocket booster carrying the crane that let the rover down contaminated the soil with its jetstream
- After driving away from the landing site, it found that the surrounding soil was extremely rich in clay
- It also found that the rocks on the surface had eroded, as if there was water flowing over them for a long period of time (they were visually simialar to a dried out riverbed on Earth)
- Curiosity used its large "arm of science" to determine a rough absolute age of liquid water on the surface of Mars


## Martian Geological Facts
- Soil on the Martian surface is 'global'
    + Unlike on the moon, the composition of the soil would not help scientists analyze the origins of the planet, as it was the same regardless of where you looked
- Geologists believed that the lading site for Spirit was a Lacustrine environment (i.e. an environment that used to be a lakebed)
- Martian soil was found to be rich in Olivine (probably the most abundant mineral on the Earth)
- Minerals such as Geothite, Silicate, Hematite and Nanophase-oxide was found near the Columbia foothills
- Rocks that had patters indicative of it experiencing multiple cycles of water being on top of it and evaporating
- The presence of Gypsum on the surface of Mars is evidence that it was once covered with water
- There is solid ice underneath the North pole, as evidenced by the Phoenix lander
- The curiosity rover found a shit ton of clay-rich soil
    + Clay minerals typically form over long periods of time form the gradual chemical weathering of rocks. They contain variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure
- Curiosity had an extremely innacurate radiometric dating system, which allowed scientists to determine the absolute age of ice on the surface, which gave scientists insight into when there was liquid water on the planet
    + It was 4.21 +/- 0.35 Byrs Old
- This allowed scientists to infer that there was once a thicker atmosphere, and liquid water on the surface of Mars
