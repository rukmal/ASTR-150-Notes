# Terrestrial Atmospheres - 4/23/15


## Question of the Day
- Where did they come from?
- What are they made of?
- How have they changed?
    + Why is Venus so hot?
    + Why is Earth so different?
    + Why is Mars so variable?


## Statistics
- Pressure [atm] Venus 92, Earth 1, Mars 0.006
- Average surface temperature [C] Venus 470, Earth 17, Mars -50


## Atmospheric Sources
- The atmosphere is mainly made up of Hydrogen and Helium, which cannot be held on to as they escape from the atmosphere
- An atmosphere formed with gasses released from the surface is sometimes called a 'secondary atmosphere'
    + On Earth, with Argon being a reference '1' H_2O is 4000, CO_2 is 4000, N_2 is 500 and Ar is 1
    + This is called 'outgassing'


## Venus Terrestrial Atmoshpere
- It has an atmosphere thick enough that you can't see the surface from space
- The Soviet Union sent a lander to the surface of Venus
- Venus is almost twice as hot as its expected temperature, as determined by its distance from the sun
    + It is the hottest planet in the solar system
- Venus's excessive heat is caused by its huge atmosphere
- On Earth, the atmosphere blocks IR radiation (heat) very efficiently
    + Greenhouse gasses absorb and scatter IR radiation
- Venus has a ton of Greenhouse gasses, which have caused it to absorb a large amout of IR radiation from the sun which has led to it warming up a lot relative to the other planets of the solar system
- Thus intuitavely, if the greenhouse gasses were to be removed from Venus it would cool down significantly

### Volcanos on Venus
- Venus is very geologically active, and has a lot of active volcanoes that produce a lot of water
- However counterintuitively, Venus has no water on its surface
- Thus, scientists determined that there must be a process on Venus that reacts with and removes water
- Due to the absence of an Ozone layer (O_3) on Venus, UV radiation is let into the atmosphere, which causes an excitation of the electrons in the H_2O bonds which in turn cause it to split into a Hydrogen molecule (H_2) and an Oxygen atom (O)
    + Due to its low mass, Hydrogen then escapses into space, which leaves the highly reactive oxygen molecule to react with other elements on Venus

### Weather on Venus
- Unlike on the surface of Earth, weather on Venus only happens at an altitude of about 40,000m
- This means that there is a 'clear' part of the atmosphere at all times dierectly above the surface
- This means that interactions between the atmosphere, and weather with the surface of the planet is much less than on Earth on Venus, due to the large gap between the layer of weather and the surface of Venus


## Earth Terrestrial Atmoshpere
- Earth's atmosphere is ~3/4 N_2 and ~1/5 O_2
- The process of weathering, twehre carbon diozide rreacts with rocks to form Carbonic acid, which in turn reacts to form CO_2, H_2O and CaCO_3 (calcium carbonate)
    + This reaction effectively reduces the amounts of CO_2 going into the reaction in the first step by 1/2. This reaciton is responsible for the lack of a high CO_2 level in our atmosphere similar to that of Venus
- About 2.6 Byrs ago, O_2 levels in the atmosphere incerased dramatically
    + We have been 'creating' oxygen for as long as there has been life on Earth
- For many years, all of the O_2 going into the atmosphere created a 'rusting' effect on the surface of the Earth, where O_2 reacted with Fe to form FeO_2 (Iron oxide, or rust)
- Evidence of this process is still seen through layering on some parts of the planet
- The atmosphere on Earth is HEAVILY affected by the presence of life on ths surface
    + Without life, Earth's atmosphere would be very similar to Venus, as CO_2 levels would spike, O_2 levels would drop, causing a spike in atmospheric pressure, which as per PV=nRT would cause the temperature to rise as the amount and volume of gas remain constant
- The effect of us burning fossil fuels has caused an increase in the Earth's atmosphere
    + This change has not happened on a typical geological timescale, but rather has happened in a fraction of the time, but rather in a matter of decades
    + This has caused a very minor albeit minor Greenhouse effect on Earth


## Mars Terrestrial Atmosphere
- For most of the year, the sky is Blue on mars during the day
- The brightness on the surface is very similar to that of Earth's surface
- The atmosphere is EXTREMELY thin (1/6000th of that of Earth's)
- The atmosphere on Mars was produces by volcanism on the surface - the pumping of CO_2 and H_2O into the atmosphere
- Mars has ice caps made of dry ice on its poles, which means that it is literally parts of the atmosphere frozen onto its surface
- Additionally, due to a tilt similar to Earth, it has seasons that are comparable
    + Additionally, due to Mars's thin atmoshpere, atmospheric fluctuation is extremely dependent on the variances in evaporation of the ice caps on Mars, which is in turn dependent on the season it is in
- Fluctuations in atmospheric pressures on Mars due to seasonal changes is VERY apparent - about half of the atmosphere appears and disappears through the cycle of the seasons
- Due to the lwoer rgravity, the size of the layer where weather is presenst (scale height) is higher than that of Earth due to lower gravity
    + Thus, it can be said that the atmosphere on Mars is more 'spread out' than on Earth


## Comparisons between the Terrestrial Atmospheres
- If you were to try to warm a 1m^2 of air using a 100W lightbulb by 10 degrees celcius is as follows (E=mC(delta)(theta))
    + Vemus - 72 minutes
    + Earth - 2 minutes
    + Mars - 1 second
