# Terrestrial Atmospheres - 4/23/15

## Question of the Day
- Where did they come from?
- What are they made of?
- How have they changed?
    + Why is Venus so hot?
    + Why is Earth so different?
    + Why is Mars so variable?


## Statistics
- Pressure [atm] Venus 92, Earth 1, Mars 0.006
- Average surface temperature [C] Venus 470, Earth 17, Mars -50


## Atmospheric Sources
- The atmosphere is mainly made up of Hydrogen and Helium, which cannot be held on to as they escape from the atmosphere
- An atmosphere formed with gasses released from the surface is sometimes called a 'secondary atmosphere'
    + On Earth, with Argon being a reference '1' H_2O is 4000, CO_2 is 4000, N_2 is 500 and Ar is 1
    + This is called 'outgassing'


## Venus Terrestrial Atmoshpere
- It has an atmosphere thick enough that you can't see the surface from space
- The Soviet Union sent a lander to the surface of Venus
- Venus is almost twice as hot as its expected temperature, as determined by its distance from the sun
    + It is the hottest planet in the solar system
- Venus's excessive heat is caused by its huge atmosphere
- On Earth, the atmosphere blocks IR radiation (heat) very efficiently
    + Greenhouse gasses absorb and scatter IR radiation
- Venus has a ton of Greenhouse gasses, which have caused it to absorb a large amout of IR radiation from the sun which has led to it warming up a lot relative to the other planets of the solar system
- Thus intuitavely, if the greenhouse gasses were to be removed from Venus it would cool down significantly

### Volcanos on Venus
- Venus is very geologically active, and has a lot of active volcanoes that produce a lot of water
- However counterintuitively, Venus has no water on its surface
- Thus, scientists determined that there must be a process on Venus that reacts with and removes water
- Due to the absence of an Ozone layer (O_3) on Venus, UV radiation is let into the atmosphere, which causes an excitation of the electrons in the H_2O bonds which in turn cause it to split into a Hydrogen molecule (H_2) and an Oxygen atom (O)
    + Due to its low mass, Hydrogen then escapses into space, which leaves the highly reactive oxygen molecule to react with other elements on Venus

### Weather on Venus
- Unlike on the surface of Earth, weather on Venus only happens at an altitude of about 40,000m
- This means that there is a 'clear' part of the atmosphere at all times dierectly above the surface
- This means that interactions between the atmosphere, and weather with the surface of the planet is much less than on Earth on Venus, due to the large gap between the layer of weather and the surface of Venus


## Earth Terrestrial Atmoshpere
- Earth's atmosphere is ~3/4 N_2 and 1/4 O_2
