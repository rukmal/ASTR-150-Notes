## Question of the Day
- What are the top 100 places in our solar system?
    + Sunx99 + Jupiter
- What can we know about a world using a few simple pieces of data?


## Numbers you Need to Know
- Age of the solar system = ~4.5 Byrs
    + Byrs = Gyrs
- Remember AU = 149,600,000 km
- Distances are usually discussed in thousands of kilometers across (Earth is 12747Km across)
- RTP: 20 C, 70F and 1atm pressure


## Most common solids in the solar sytem
- Iron (7.9)
- Rocks (~3)
- Ice/Water (1.0)
    + Note: Numbers in brackets are densities in g/cm^3


## Ancient Earth History

### ~1 Byrs Ago
- Single large supercontinent - Rodinia
- Life had evolved to a unicellular organisms, but not beyond that
- Contrasts highly with the moon - only 2 craters have changed on the visible side

### ~1 Myrs Ago
- Surface of the earth was very similar

### ~1 Tyrs Ago
- Essentially insignificant
Jupiter's moon Io changed significantly over the last 1000 years


## Densities of Planets
- Mercury, which is made of Iron and Rock has a density of 5.4g/cm^3
- Enceladus, which is made of Ice and Rock has a density of 1.6g/cm^3

### Inference
- Using the density of a planet, you can get an idea of its basic composition using the absolute densities of Ice, Rock and Iron which are the most abundant building blocks for planets in our solar system
- Eg:
    + The moon Vesta has a density of 2.9, which would mean that it is mostly made of rock
- When plotting a graph of the density as you travel towards the core of a planet, it goes up unnaturally regardless of the composition of the planet. This is due to the cumulative mass of the surface of the planet compressing the core, which increases its density


## Moment of Inertia
- In layman's terms, it is how hard it is to rotate an object
- Gives insight into the distribution of the composition of the elements of a planet (i.e. percentage of rock vs. water, etc.) by mass
- For a higher density planet, the mass of the core is higher, which would lead to a lower moment of inertia
- Denoted by K, the moments of inertia we will be dealing with will always be <= 0.4, which is the moment of inertia of a uniform sphere
    + Interesting fact: The moment of inertia of the moon is almost 0.4, due to the fact that it is almost a uniform sphere (one of the only planets in our solar system)
    + Planets made mostly of gas, such as Jupiter and Saturn have very low moments of inertia

## Albedo
- Definition: The percentage of sunlight that reflects off a surface (denoted by A)
- 0 is dark (completely non reflective), or 1 (completely reflective)
    + Paper has an albedo of 0.66 (i.e. 66%)
    + Asphalt has an albedo of 0.1, and for sidewalk concrete A = ~0.5
- Albedos are dynamic. For example, on earth it changes with the seasons due to the presence and absence of snow.


## Atmospheres
- The atmosphere of planets significantly affects the appearance and properties of the surface of planets
- The peak of everest is above 66% of the earth's atmosphere, which indicates that it is *very thin*

### Phases of Matter
- Dependent on Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure
    + No atmosphere = no pressure

### Variation between planets
- Mars, Earth, Titan and Venus all have diferent atmispheres
- Thsi is due to the fact that some planets have varying levels of atmospheres, which drastically affect the temperature.
- PV=nRT, so if P=0, n=0 as there is no containment
