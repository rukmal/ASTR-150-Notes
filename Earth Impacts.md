# Earth Impacts (K-T) - 4/28/15

## Question of the Day
- How do impact craters on Earth differ from those on other planets?
- What is the evidence that a giant impact occured on Earth 65 million years ago?
- Why is this event important to us?
- Are we going to get hit in the future?


## Earth Impacts
- Despite the lack of evidence on the surface (i.e. hella craters), the Earth is impacted about 10x more than the moon
- Recently, the discovery rate of Near=Earth asteroids has skyrocketed in the last coulple of decades, amounting to about 20k metric tons of material
    + Despite this number seeming huge, its actually very small realtive to the mass of the Earth
- When impacts ahppen, they appear as 'fireballs' in the sky, due to the heat generated by friction caused by the Earth's atmosphere
- Occasionally, some asteroids are large enough to make it through to the lower atmosphere without being completely disintegrated in the upper atmosphere
    + When they hit the ground, they are called 'meteorites'
- Occasionally, there are meteors large enough to affect the geological processes on Earth


## Impact Craters on Earth
- Impact craters are still being discovered every day
- There are no accurate estimates the number of impact craters due to the heavy bias in existing data (no puclic hq ocean maps, lower study in some countries etc.)
- Due to Earth's geological activity, most every crater on the Earth is a ghost crater (i.e. modified from its form on impact due to the planet's geological, atmospheric and environmental activity [people also sometimes intervene])
- The reason that we constantly discover new craters on the surface is because we discover something out of the ordinary
    + For the most part, we discover impact breccia, which appear to be pieces of broken sidewalk
- In Nordlingen, Germany there are buildings built of impact breccia, as they were built in and aroundi mpact craters
- During the recession of the last ice age, there were many impact craters that were exposed (they were initially covered by ice)
- Like Venus, Earth lacks small craters
    + The presence of an atmosphere contributes to this, due to the fact that small asteroids are often burnt up in the atmosphere before impact
    + Interactions and changes caused by people causes small impact craters to not last, as opposed to large impact craters
- When comparing the ages of the craters on Earth, they fit the general crater counting curve depending on the crater density (N(10)) of the region from which the samples were dated


## The Extinction of Dinosaurs
- Note: 'dinosaurs' in this sense encapsulate all life, ranging from plankton in the sea to T-Rexes on the surface
- In 1980, a paper was published that postulated that large scale biological change was caused by meteor impact about 65 million years ago (about the time the dinosaurs disappeared)
- Graphs of Marine Biodiversity show a sharp drop about 65 million years ago (one of about 5 in the last 500Myrs), which imply that there was a large extinction event that occured
- This mass extinction event left mass changes on the Earth, apparent in changes in soil color and composition in places of layering
- The mass extinction event that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs was the first event that was not domestic (to planet Earth), as it was caused by an asteroid
- When analyzing the layers, there was an abundance of Iridium at 65Myrs ago (dinosaur extinction date)
    + There was no Iridium (Ir) in the samples before, or after the point in time 65 Myrs ago
- Iridium is an extremely high density metal, in teh Platinum group of metals
    + They are known to dissolve very easily in Iron, so most of the iridium on Earth is foudn in the center of the core (which is molten iron)
    + It is however, VERY prevalent in meteors which helped the researchers reach the conclusion that the extinction of the dinosaurs was in fact caused by an asteroid
