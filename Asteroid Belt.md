# Asteroid Belt - 5/7/15


## Question of the Day
- Asteroids - what are their characteristics?
- What is the origin of the asteroid belt?
- Physical structure - where are the asteroids?
- Why are resonances important?
- Chemical structure - composition vs. distance


## Asteroid Belt Discovery
- Started with early astronomers looking for the 'missing' planet in Bode's law, that was supposed to be located at 2.8 AU
- It started with the discoveey of Ceres, which then led to the 4 most heavy asteroids in the belt
    + They make up half of its mass
- There were 2 major 'jumps' in discovery, because of technological advances
    + The use of cameras at the beginning of the 20th century
    + The use of CCD's (charge coupled devices, i.e. digital cameras) beginning in the 1980's has led to the discovery of 0.5M+ asteroids in the belt


## Main Physical Characteristics of the Belt
- As the size reduces, they tend to be less round, and become increasingly more irregular
- Smaller asteroids tend to become more 'potato shaped'
- Mathematically, you can only have an irregular asteroid that is at most ~500km across
- As Geological activity scales with size, their surfaces are generally very old (for the asteroids in the belt, as they have been there fro a long time)
- Due to their small size, it is sometimes innacurate to use the crater counting method is highly innacurate to use crater counting to determine its age
- The average distance between asteroids is ~6x the distance from the Earth to the Moon
- We can determine the material composition of the asteroids using their reflectance of light
- There is a compositional change of the asteroids as you move through the atmosphere, from the sun outwards


## Age Determination
- Due to their small size, using crater counting to determine realtive age is not a viable approach
- Scientits found through observation that small asteroids did not have the right amount of small craters (they should theoretically have a lot, due to the fact taht it is an old surface)
- It was hypothesized that instead of cratering, due to its small size these asteroids actuallly fracture. Due to their low gravitational field, the fractured pieces can fly apart from each other and form two smaller asteroids


## Origin of the Asteroid Belt
- One of the first ideas proposed was that there used to be a planet there that was catastrophically destroyed
    + This theory was debunked due to the presence of Carbonaceous Chondrite meteorites, which have to have come form objects that never differentiated, and were never exposed to high temperatures
- When plotting the orbits of the asteroids, most of the orbits are limited by the Sun on one end, and jupiter on the other
    + "Jupiter will be the cause of everyone's problems"


## Gravitational Mechanics of Jupiter
- There are points that exist in gravitational interactions, called lagrange poitns where the gravitational force is stable
- There are no asteroids in prbits that are in resonnance with Jupiter
    + This is because of the fact that resonances change orbits
    + The effect of the resonnances eventually cause it to escape the orbit of Jupiter, and they will effectively be 'ejected' into the inner solar system
    + It is this mechanism that causes asteroids to be pushed into inner solar system orbits
- Vesta has a "huge ass" impact crater on its surface, which would have caused it to have ejected a large maount of material into the belt
    + As Vesta is large enough to be geologically active in the past, it is safe to assume that all of the Achondrite meteorites that impact the Earth originated from Vesta


## Effect on Outer Solar System
- The asteroid belt is the 'magic point', called the snow line where ice can form freely. This means that ice becomes a major building material (@ ~3 AU)
