# Apollo - 4/7/15


## Question of the Day
- Why go to the moon?
- How do you get the history of the moon from 840lbs of rocks collected at six landing sites?


## Space Race Facts
- 400k+ people worked on the project
- Space eace was basically 1960-1970
- Started after Yuri Gagarin (Russian Cosmonaut) was the first man in space
- JFK charged NASA with putting a man on the moon and brining him safely back on May 21, 1961
- The soviet proton rocket (the one used to send astronauts to the ISS) is the most flown rocket in the world
- The Russians designed a rocket called the N1 to compete with the Saturn V, which exploded on launch the four times it launched (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLMkhdf1_o)
- Only two astronauts of the Apollo program were not military personnel during the program


## Landings and Facts
- Contrained to staying near the equator towards the center of the moon
- The early missions to the moon were to relatively 'boring' parts of the moon to reduce landing complications
    + Apollo 11 landed in a lava plain called the 'Sea of Tranquility'
- Fact: It was a law that the astronauts **had** to plant the American flag on the surface
- Rock collection
    + The astronauts recovered Basalt rocks (3.6 Byrs old)
- Apollo 12 landed on a different lava plain on the West side of the moon
    + They landed right next to a prevously sent capsule called 'Surveyor 3', which proved that they could land on the moon with relatively good positional accuracy
    + They also helped determine the age of one of the youngest craters on the moon (Copernicus Crater Ray, 0.8 Byrs)


## Moon Facts
- Cumulative creater density = N(10) [The total number of craters equal to or larger than 10km per Million square km]
