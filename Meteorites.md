# Meteorites - 5/5/15


## Question of the Day
- Where do we find them?
- Where do they come from?
- What kinds are there?
- How did they form?
- When did they form?


## History of Meteorites
- The Earth has been impacted with meteorites since before there were humans on the planet
- There were some daggers in Tatankhamun's tomb, some of which were made with metallic iron. At the time, we did not know how to smelt iron, so it must have come from meteorite materials
- They often end up in venerated places, due to their rarity and apparent religious significance (rocks falling from the sky)
- Erns Florens Friedrich Chladni was the first person to suggest that meteorites were extraterrestrial
- As we moved into the 1800s, it becase quite well established that meteorites are in fact extraterrestrial
- Of the 1000s of meteorites only a few are recovered. This is due to the fact that meteorites bombard the Earth realtively evenly, so about 2/3rds are lost in the ocean, and others are often lost due to the non-even distribution of people on the planet
- A ton of meteorites are found near the foothills of the mountain range in Antartica (~80% of all recorded recovered meteorites to date)


## Where do they come from?
- This is asking where the 'parent body' of the meteorites came from/is currently
- Computer simulations show that about 8% of all material thrown off the Martian surface impacts Earth's atmosphere as a meteorite

### Sources of Meteorites
- Mars
    + There are about 35 meteorites collected to date that have been proved to be from Mars
    + This age is determined by radiometric dating, which can then be used to determine the world it came form, relative to how long ago geological activity occured on each of the worlds
- Moon
    + The rocks collected from the surface of the moon are illegal to own, as they were collected using taxpayer money
    + About 30 meteorites that have impacted the Earth have been proven to be from the surface of the moon
- The Asteroid Belt
    + Tracing the paths of about a dozen meteorites that have impacted the Earth using video record shows that they originated somewhere between Mars and Jupiter
    + These recovered rocks give us our first samples from the outer part of the solar system
    + The material compostion of asteroids can be determined depending on how they reflect light (i.e. using their reflectance)

### Meteorites on Other Worlds
- Multiple rovers on the surface of Mars has found many meteorites on its surface, due to its relatively unchanging, desert surface
- 30+ meteorites have been found on the surface of Mars


## What kinds are there?
- Meteorites made of different materials are classified differently as follows:
    + Stony meteorites - 94% of Earth impacts
    + Stony Iron - 1.2% of Earth impacts
    + Iron - 4.8% of Earth impacts
- This tells us that there are only very few pure iron meteorites

### Stony Meteorites
- Scientists have divided stony meteorites into two separate categories
- Chondrites
    + Divided into two more categories
    + Carbonaceous Chondrites - 3.6% of Earth impacts
        * Analysis of some impacts in the United States show that the meteorites recovered were very brittle
        * They were found to be made up of Carbon-rich chondrules, which were made up of complex carbon lattices
        * They have almost the same chemical composition as the sun (in terms of the heavy materials)
        * As they never had any heavy materials, it indicates that it never underwent nuclear fission, so there were no heavy materials in it
        * This indicates that this is one of the most primitive objects in the solar system
        * These rocks were used to determine the age of the solar system, due to its primitive nature
            - These are the rocks that were used to determine the estimate that the solar system is ~4.5Byrs old
        * There were a couple of meteorites, one of which was called the Murchinson meteorite was the first extraterrestrial material to have organic Hydrocarbons and Amino acids from non-Earth material
        * These types of materials are extremely hard to collect, as they are extremely structurally weak and thus weather quickly. They are also known to be extremely similar to regular Earth rocks in terms of their appearance
    + Ordinary Chondrites - 73.5%
        * They are made of chondrules - little spherical pieces
        * However, unlike carbonaceous chondrites, they have been heated and altered, containing metallic iron
        * This shows that there is very little separation between iron and the rock in the meteorite, as the chondrules are convoluted and mixed due to heating
        * Compared to Carbonacrous Chrondrites, ordinary chondrites lack volatiles, which would be due to heating
        * This tells us that most asteroids in the asteroid belt have been heated, but not enough for them to be differentiated (i.e. heavy elements exclusively in the core, and lighter ones near the surface)
        * They are also about 4.5Byrs old
        * They date back to almost the origin of the solar system
- Achondrites
    + As the name implies, they do not have chondrites
    + They are generally pieces of Basalt and Highland rock
    + Every rock we pick up on the Earth could essentially be classified as an Achondrite meteorite
    + They come from surfaces that either are/were geologically active at some point in time
    + They are the formal original lava flow and/or crust of meteorites, as they are geologically altered
        * One would assume that these rocks are different from that of the Chondrites, as they have been heated
    + They are however ancient, also ~4.5Byrs old which imply that all meteorites in our solar system are ancient

### Stony Iron Meteorites
- The sexiest meteorite
- This is due to the mixture of rock and iron in the rock
- The distribution of the composition of the meteorite changes, some have more iron relative to stone, whereas others have more stone relative to iron
    + They can be cut thin to allow light to shine through, which make them good material for jewellery and stuff
- Due to their mixed composition, they must be from the transition zone of differentiated asteroids
    + This contributes to their rarity, as they must have come from a specific, small portion of an asteroid large enough to have sustained enough geological activity to differentiate enough to have a transition stage

### Iron Meteorites
- They are often large, blocks of iron
- It is easy to find these using metal detectors and magnets
- They do not weather, so it is relatively easy to find them
- If you bath a cross-section of an iron meteorite, it forms a unique pattern called the Widmanstatten pattern, which is only formed on Iron that is cooled about 1 degree every 1Myrs
- The slower the iron cools, the larger the patterns are
    + This indicates that iron meteorites with large patterns must have originated somewhere that iron cooled extremely slowly
    + This fact is used to determine the size and composition of the parent bodies of these asteroids
- All iron meteorites come from the cores of differentiated asteroids
- Radiometric dating indivates that they are also very ancient, clocking in at ~4.5Byrs old
- Asteroids were formed so early and cooled so fast that all of the material formed on them has remained unchanged since about the beginning of the solar system


## Analysis of the Solar System from Meteorites
- The composition and the origin of the meteorites indicates that most of the asteroid belt is formed with geologically simple primitive materials
